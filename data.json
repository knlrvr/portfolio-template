I deliver high-quality, production-ready code for a diverse array of projects for clients, tailored to their needs and the needs of the commununities they serve. My work mostly consists of code, but I've had the pleasure of working in various areas of digital design, including but not limited to front-end development, UI/UX design, & graphic design. It's my goal in my work to commit myself to accessibility, equity, education, & sustainability and I do my best to contribute to those ideals whenever and however I can. Outside of work, I try to hone my creativity through multiple outlets. I write & play music, I'm an avid D&D nerd and gamer, I love to explore the world with my fianc√©e & play with my dog, Sundance, and my cat, Tadashi.",
