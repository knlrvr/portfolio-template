## Description
This is a portfolio template anyone can use to get started! All you have to do is modify the information in the json file and you're good to go! 

This portfolio template was inspired by [this CV created by Bartosz Jarocki with shadcn & next.js](https://cv.jarocki.me/). I really liked the minimal design & wanted to recreate it with just HTML & CSS!
